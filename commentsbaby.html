        <p>Hello Paula Deen's Fun House,<br> I just wanted to say thanks.  Paula has deserved such a dedicated site for years and none have been around. I think this is the perfect way to depict her awesomeness and dedication to butter. Such a wonderful lady. <br> -PaulaLover2000</p>
        <p>Hello Paula Deen's Fun House,<br> I think this website is <strong>NOT</strong> a depiction of how she's such a <em>great</em> lady. I think this website exposes her as an equivalent to the Queen of Hearts. She will cut her viewers' heads off slowly with sticks of butter.<br> -PaulaSux1999</p>
        <p>Hello Paula Deen's Fun House, <br> I wanted to share my information on a book I came across called Blue Eyes, Butter, and Bigotry. It is quite a read. <br>-BooksRLife</p>
